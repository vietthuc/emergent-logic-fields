# Emergent Logic Fields

This is an open-source prototype exploring symbolic reasoning using sparse rhythmic oscillations, instead of dense language corpora or neural transformers. The goal is to discover whether simple oscillatory structures can encode logic gates and inference through phase interference and harmonic resonance.

This work is part of a broader exploration into low-resource, rhythm-driven AI systems, inspired by natural signal processing in biological systems.

## Status

Early-stage simulation. The prototype is being developed in Python with CuPy for GPU acceleration.

## Objectives

- Encode AND / OR / NOT gates via stable interference.
- Use rhythmic pulses (not tokens) to represent logical propositions.
- Explore the emergence of symbolic structure through dynamics.
- Run on modest local hardware, independent of large datasets.
